E-commerce of watches.

You can register, where the data will be stored in a Firebase database.

Then you can log in and look at the different watches that the e-commerce has to offer with up to 4 different categories of watches.

Once you select the quantity of watches to buy, they will be sent to the cart, you can continue shopping or complete the order.

Inside the cart you can delete specific products or all the products together that you do not want to buy or proceed to checkout.

Finally in the checkout you will have to fill the form with your data to confirm the purchase.  Once the purchase has been sent, you will be given a purchase order number.
